Once Gaphor is started a new empty model is automatically created. The main
diagram is already open in the Diagram section.

Select an element you want to place (e.g. a class) by clicking on the icon
in the Toolbox and click on the diagram. This will place a new Class item
instance on the diagram and add a new Class to the model (it shows up in the
Navigation.  The selected tool will reset itself to the Pointer tool after
the element is placed on the diagram.

It's simple to add elements to a diagram.

Some elements are not directly visible. The section in the toolbox is
collapsed and needs to be clicked first to reveal its contents.

Gaphor does not make any assumptions about which elements should be placed
on a diagram. A diagram is a diagram. UML defines all different kinds of
diagrams, such as Class diagrams, Component diagrams, Action diagrams,
Sequence diagrams. But Gaphor does not place any restrictions.

## Creating New Diagrams

![image](/images/navpopup.png)

To create a new diagram, use the Navigation section. Select an element that
can contain a diagram (a Package or Profile) and right-click. Select New
diagram and a new diagram is created. As of Gaphor 1.1.0 a buttion is
available in the header bar. Select a package and you'll notice the button
is not grayed out and can be clicked, resulting in a new diagram being added
to the model.

## Másolás és beillesztés

Items in a diagram can be copied and pasted (in the same diagram or
another). A paste will create new items in the diagrams, the items they
represent (e.g. the Class that's shown in the Navigation) is *not* copied
(call it a shallow copy if you like).

This way you can easely create visual copies of the same (underlaying) model
element.

## Drag and Drop

Adding an existing element to a diagram is simple: drag the element from the
Navigation section onto a diagram. Not all elements that show up in the
Navigation can be added: Diagrams and attribute/operations of a Class can
not be added.

Elements can also be dragged within the Navigation section. This way classes
and packages can be rearranged for example.
